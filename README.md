# ETHGlobal-New-Tork-2025 ToolBooth


## Team

We are a team of full-stack/Web3 builders with prior hackathon experience:

* ETHGlobal NYC (Coinbase challenge): ToolBooth with x402 on Base, MCP server for agents, subscription model via Flow callbacks.
* ETHGlobal Flow: Implemented callback scheduler for subscription logic.
* Experience across React/Next.js, smart contracts, wallets, and agent integrations.

Weâ€™ve proven the primitives â€” micropaywalls, expiry, subscriptions, facilitator UX â€” and are now translating them into the Zircuit ecosystem.

---

## Testing the Integration

For future PoC milestones:

* Deploy TollBooth.sol on Garfield Testnet.
* Verify contract via Zircuit Explorer.
* Configure facilitator with ZIRCUIT_RPC endpoint.
* Run demo site with middleware: should serve content only if Access Pass is valid.

---

## Feedback on Building on Zircuit

We expect two key developer advantages:

* SLS context: reduces app-level anti-fraud logic.
* AA (7702) support: simplifies ephemeral agent sessions, drastically improving UX.

These features make Zircuit the best possible chain for scaling pay-per-access into a universal primitive.

---

## Optional (Future Work)

* Pitch video: quick walkthrough of problem, demo site, Garfield deployment.
* Stretch goal: staking mechanism for facilitators; yield redirection of idle balances.

---

ðŸ‘‰ With ToolBooth on Zircuit, pay-per-access becomes safer, smoother, and unavoidable â€” making Zircuit the natural hub for all x402-style micropayments.

Do you want me to also draft the one-sentence + why we should win lines in a very tight, marketing-ready format (like the exact phrasing youâ€™d paste into the submission form), or should I keep it only inside the README?
